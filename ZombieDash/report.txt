1. A high-level description of each of your public member functions in each of
your classes, and why you chose to define each member function in its host
class; also explain why (or why not) you decided to make each function
virtual or pure virtual. For example, “I chose to define a pure virtual version
of the sneeze() function in my base Actor class because all actors in Zombie
Dash are able to sneeze, and each type of actor sneezes in a different way.”

2. A list of all functionality that you failed to finish as well as known bugs in
your classes, e.g. “I didn’t implement the Flame class.” or “My smart zombie
doesn’t work correctly yet so I treat it like a dumb zombie right now.”

3. A list of other design decisions and assumptions you made; e.g., “It was not
specified what to do in situation X, so this is what I decided to do.”

4. A description of how you tested each of your classes (1-2 paragraphs per
class).
